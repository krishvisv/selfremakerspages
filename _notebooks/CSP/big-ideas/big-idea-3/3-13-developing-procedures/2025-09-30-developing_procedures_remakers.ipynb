    "## Story: The Dessert Robot- The Importance of Naming\n",
    "Imagine a robot chef who makes desserts. If we tell the robot `makeDessert()` it needs clear sub-steps: `measureFlour()`, `mixIngredients()`, `bake()`. Additionally, if we need to review code later, it is much easier to find the series of events responsible for `makeDessert()`. If we instead call everything `doIt()` the robot — and humans reading the code — get confused. Clear names make code easier to read, test, and reuse."
